1)Bonus:
We added colors and scores,
Please pay attention, after the row deleted, all the shapes above changed their color to white.
If a player decided to pause a game and press (4) to continue,all the saves shapes will be colored white.
When a row is full, the row will be marked in red and then will be deleted,the game will be paused
for few seconds in order to emphasize to all the players that the row deleted.
The colors option can be changed in the settings.

2)Compter game:
  The optimal place for computer game is by checking first if there is an empty path to this place , if not we move to the next place.
 If there is an empty path we check by maximum number of deleted lines and if there is no deleted lines we find the most lower place.
This check is performed for every optional rotate.

3)Level:
BEST -  calculate by 2.
GOOD - should miss occasionally (randomly, once in ~15 shapes)
NOVICE - should miss occasionally (randomly, once in ~5 shapes)
